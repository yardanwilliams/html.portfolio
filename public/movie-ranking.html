<h1>The best movies according to Yardan</h1>

 <h2>My top 3 greatest films of all time
</h2>
<hr />
 <h3>Dune</h3>
 <p>It stays true to the novels and I love the sci-fi aspects of it. The fight scenes are amazing and action packed,
 the plot is good and the power/magic system is wonderous and piques your curiosity.</p>

 <h3>The Hobbit trilogy</h3>
 <p>The Hobbit is a fun and adventurous film with an amazing plot. 
 It is the prequel to the Lord Of The Rings and has a ton of world building and lore.
</p>
 <h3>Alien movies</h3>
 <p>As a sci-fi fan, the Alien movies stand out to me as some of the greatest in it's genre.
 It is freaky, gory and will have you on the edge of your seat most of the time.
 Plot is good and it is also action packed</p>
